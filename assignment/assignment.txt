Complete the assignment described in the attached pdf file.  You should include a makefile which will cleanly
build your code with -Wall.

When finished, push your code to the github classroom repository and indicate in Blackboard the name of your repository.

There are no questions to answer on this particular assignment.  Rather, you are to implement a solution to this problem.

Make sure your code is properly commented and compiles cleanly.  It also should have all appropriate synchronization constructs included.
